The most obvious mantra that any developer gleefully ignores is "think first, code second."

"Pssh," we think to ourselves, "I can do both at the same time! I can even design the layout as I go."

Obviously this is something I've ignored plenty of times. But for a personal project I've been working on, I decided to try something completely foreign and unthinkable:

I decided to plan ahead.

Before I let myself write a single line of code, I wrote out the problems I was trying to solve and sketched out simple wireframes.

Even though I'm terrible at creating designs, I found the wireframe was already revealing several issues I would've overlooked if I'd jumped right into coding. I saw that there wasn't a clear hierarchy separating things like a "task" from a "project", and that it would be confusing to a new user.

This was the kind of UI problem that gets easily overlooked once you dive into a codebase and start building things out.
